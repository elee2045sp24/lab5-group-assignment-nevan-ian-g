· A project title: Pong Extended

· Nevan Mukherjee, Ian Garrison

· A description of the desired functionality for the project/project (goals):
We are making the basic pong game using pygame, and then adding some cool features. We are using computer vision to 
use our hands to control the paddles, as opposed to a throttle or button. Furthermore, we are planning
to use our simulation knowledge to add other features like different difficulty, and power ups. We may also
incorporate the M5 as a remote controller in some way.
